The `transfer` action transfers core EOS tokens between two accounts.

As an authorized party I, {{ signer }}, wish to transfer {{ quantity }} EOS tokens from {{ from }} to {{ to }} with the memo {{ memo }}.

If I am not the beneficial owner of these tokens, I stipulate that I have been authorized to transfer ownership of these tokens by their beneficial owner(s).

I understand that transfers are irreversible after any pre-configured delays have elapsed. 

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed after receiving goods or services from {{ to }}, I agree to either return the goods or services or resend {{ quantity }} in a timely manner.
