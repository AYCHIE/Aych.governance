By EOS Amsterdam: to proudly serve the community. Author: Jetse Sprey. EOS Amsterdam accepts no liability whatsoever regarding this document.

#
We deliberately did not define EOS. We all know what the EOS governed blockchain is, but it is difficult to describe EOS in a decisive way. That&#39;s why we have left this open. There will be some sort of a grey area that needs to be filled in by jurisprudence but we believe that would also have been there, should we have tried to nail down all the EOS elements relevant for this charter.

3

#
In order to ensure acceptance, a party that is new to EOS shall have to be informed of the applicability of this charter to all agreements concluded. Also the text of this charter needs at the latest at the start of the use of the conclusion of a (smart) contract to be served to that party. The party preferably ticks a box but this is not required.

#
&quot;Good faith&quot; is commonly used in one form or the other in many jurisdictions between contract parties. What this means exactly is dependent of the actual facts and circumstances that need to be determined in each case. However, in many cases there is hardly any doubt. It is, e.g., clear that lying and stealing cannot be done in good faith.
A party needs to be compliant to local laws as well obviously but this is not really an EOS issue. We chose to leave that out here since it is self evident and we don&#39;t want to make that obligation enforceable between the parties. Many obligations stem from public law and we don&#39;t want that always to play a role in a civil lawsuit. By way of example: if a party has to pay VAT and doesn&#39;t do that, another party shouldn&#39;t be able to sue over that .Unless, of course, this tax evasion leads to damagers with that party.

#
Ownership is an open concept. It is the most comprehensive set of rights a person (legal entity or human being) has regarding a good or right, an asset. The owner of the house is the person registered in the public registry (in Europe at least). The owner of a bike is the person that is entitled to sell it and use it (unless he has rented it out). The owner of a token is the person that is entitled to sell it and is entitled to receive the sales price. That person could be the key holder to such token.But the key holder could also hold the token for someone else. Than that someone else is the real owner.

6

#
This is to ensure EOS is not taken over by one party. It might be difficult to establish but we believe that the legal challenges (including claims for damages) an owner of more than 10% will encounter, are of such a magnitude that it is not worth taking the risk. We distinguished between ownership and voting.

7

#
So if a person owns two companies that each own 0,7% of the issued EOS tokens, both companies together can only cast 1% of the issued EOS tokens.

8

#
We decided to lower the threshold to a level where a voter cannot appoint single handedly all bps.

9

#
 These elements are often used to determine whether or not someone has a kartel in the off chain world. I am not fond of more or less subjective norms but they are needed to stop unwanted behaviour that falls outside of the clearly forbidden actions.

10

#
This would mean that the instructions need to be given in the language of the agreement. Otherwise the proxy cannot proof that the owner did get the instructions.

11

#
Proxy voting is fine. Also if such proxy were to cast more than 5% of the votes. But voters shouldn&#39;t be locked in. In other words: a combination of an exchange service and proxy voting will mean that the owner cannot freely choose his or hers proxy since that would mean they would have to leave the exchange which is burdensome. So in that event the exchange shall have to allow for voting instructions by such owner. This is loosely based on general notices in the law about the way power of attorneys work (which a proxy is).

12

#
Common control would diminish competition between the block producers. Also it could make the chain vulnerable to outside pressures since the chain is being operated by fewer parties. That&#39;s why we have introduced a ban on common control. To know if there is common control, we suggested simple measures. A block producer has to publish its group structure. (A group meaning entities that are under common control and/or work as an economic entity). As well as their ultimate beneficiaries.

13

#
This doesn&#39;t mean a BP is obliged to follow a court order or arbitrator&#39;s award. That is up to their own discretion. However, if a verdict clearly shows that e.g. theft has taken place, a BP will act accordingly. It is further possible that a BP is a party to certain proceedings. Then also this clause ensures that they do not become liable if they act in accordance with the outcome of such proceedings. They only must follow an arbitrator&#39;s award under this charter if it has been provided by a selected arbitrator. That is in the following paragraph (7.4).

14

#
Such as an emergency award.

15

#
This clause is only applicable if and in as far there is no arbitrator&#39;s order yet. Please note further that in the event the block producer makes a mistake here, the block producer may become liable. But if in the event of a clear infringement of which the block producer is aware, the block producer refrains from action such block producer may become liable also.

16

#
This is meant generally and, for the avoidance of doubt, is also applicable to the decision whether or not to execute the code taken in 7.3.2. So unless the BP takes that decision intently wrong (or grossly negligently wrong), the BP is not liable.

17

#
This is to encourage the writing of code and (smart) contracts. Who shall be considered to be a developer shall have to be broadly interpreted (and include also the writers of this charter).

18

#
Once the WPS is off the ground, it should run on its own.

#
This clause clarifies that a party shall be liable if such party doesn&#39;t comply and under which circumstances such party is liable. First of all the damages to be reimbursed has to have a connection with the default situation. If this is not the case, no liability shall occur. Nevertheless, a party may claim that a default situation is repaired. So, e.g. if a party casts more than 1% of the votes this will mean that other block producers will receive less EOS. This is easy to calculate. That &quot;over&quot; casting party, shall be liable for such amounts towards the block producers. Each of those block producers could claim the amount of their damage. Damage is typically calculated by comparing the situation of no default with the default situation. The amount of the difference is the amount of the damages. By making this comparison, one should take into account not only the turnover lost but also the savings in costs made (if any).

20

#
So the principle is that the parties themselves choose their dispute resolution. They are free to do so. Even if it concerns EOS. Even if it regards disputes about this charter or the execution of the EOS core code. That must be done in their agreements and, in the event they have not done so, they can do so once the dispute has occurred. If they to not do so, the default dispute resolution comes into play. In the event of theft, there is no agreement between the parties (parties here being the thief and his victim) and therefore the default forum shall apply. Please note that the BPs are not obliged to follow awards from arbitrators other than those of the selected arbitration provider. We believe it is necessary to have one or more default arbitration providers. If not, this could lead to an unnecessary level of insecurity about the forum in the event the parties do not choose a forum or in the event such choice is invalid.

21

#
Such system of selected arbitrators to be drafted and established in accordance with the following paragraph.
**Arbitration**
ECAF is there now. When this charter is in force, the block producers meeting shall have to formally appoint ECAF should they want them to be (one of the) arbitration providers. I have introduced language that allows for ECAF to continue untill the block producers meeting has provided another selected arbitration provider.

It will be possible to have various providers for various problems. E.g. Wipo arbitration could be used for pure intellectual property disputes. Further the arbitration system shall have to mention the costs. Those may vary in accordance with the complexity of the case. It should be very clear that dispute resolution is costly, though. this shouldn&#39;t be a major issue, if the amounts are considerable. With smaller amounts, costs will start to hurt. That&#39;s why many dispute resolution providers offer simple, straightforward business-consumer solutions against far lower costs. The BPs meeting can introduce such low cost arbitration for low level disputes.

22

#
An arbitrator can rule in accordance with the law or in fairness. This is EOS. We don&#39;t want legal small print that complicate so many court cases. That&#39;s why we choose for fairness..

23

#
One may have cheap and simple proceedings for simple cases (e.g. theft) and extensive (and therefore expensive) proceedings for complicated cases (e.g. the question whether or not block producers voted in an orchestrated way).

24

#
Appeal is essential in an emerging legal system. It is needed to align the various verdicts and work towards clear and predictable rules.

25

#
We believe mediation often provides quick and cheap dispute resolution;

26

#
There need to be a body that is entitled to decide on code and that further details the rules if and when necessary. Without this body all extra rules are legally amendments to the charter (as such extra rules would in fact be an amendment to all other contracts or constitutions). Such amendments would than all need a referendum since the contract is changed. That is highly impractical. Determining a &quot; lower&quot; body to further establish the community rules is called &quot;delegation&quot;.

27

#
In the event the BPs shall draft an agreement that is too good for them, they risk to be voted out.

28

#
As for the Sudo discussion: (if we are correctly informed), Sudo provides a way of exercising BPs powers that BPs already have but do it in a more streamlined manner. Such a system wouldn&#39;t be against this charter.

29

#
We have discussed this intently. We understand that choosing an applicable law is contrary to the decentralization idea. However we don&#39;t have much choice. We cannot make a new order of rules. There will always be a law applicable. Law doesn&#39;t care about how international a system is. Law is being applied whether one likes it or not. One has only the freedom to choose his or hers applicable law (a freedom that isn&#39;t absolute by the way). If the parties do not choose their applicable law, such law will be determined by the conflict law system. Any gaps in the agreement are being filled in (or not) by the applicable law. So if one doesn&#39;t choose one applicable law, this might mean that this charter does not do what it is supposed to do because another jurisdiction may require specific texts that are not in here.. The impact of the applicable law shouldn&#39;t be overstated. It just depends. Especially if the language of an agreement is unambiguous, such texts are probably be leading in many law systems and the result would be similar regardless of the applicable law.

Any civil law system is in principle fine with us. However this charter is drawn up in accordance with Dutch law and we have a strong preference for that. Should we select e.g. Swiss law a Swiss lawyer will need to check this charter as well. Common law (used in India, the US and the UK) is, based on our rather sketchy knowledge, probably more problematic. We are regrettably not familiar with Chinese and the other Asian law systems. We look forward to any comments from that part of the world.
