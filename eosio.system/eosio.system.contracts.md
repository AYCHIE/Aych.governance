The User acknowledges and agrees that the User is using the EOS blockchain at their sole risk.

## Article II - Special User Types
Users who call `regproducer` agree to, and are bound by, the *regproducer* Ricardian Contract.

## Article III - Consent of the EUA
The nature of the *EOS User Agreement* is such that it serves as a description of the current EOS Mainnet governance functions that are in place. These functions, enforced by code, do not require the consent of Users as these functions are inherent and systemic to the EOS Mainnet itself.

## Article IV - Governing Documents
